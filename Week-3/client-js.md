working with the DOM

how the we access is?
  document
  but first
    navigator : an object which represent the common props of browsers
                 (the first browser was called Navigator that's why the name)
    window    : It represents the browser's window. All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.



document. functions :
    querrySelector() -> returns the first element
    querrySelectorAll() -> returns a node (alias DOM) list
    createElement()
    createTextNode()
