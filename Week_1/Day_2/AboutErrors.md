#Errors

## Error types
* ### Syntax Errors
  * Unexpected token -> frequently means we're missing a parenthesis, bracket or curly brace. In our case, we're missing a }
  * Reference Errors ->  occurs when we're trying to use the value of an undefined variable.
  * Type Errors      -> JavaScript is telling us that one of the used name is undefined, it usually means a wrong function call (e. g. type in a function name)
