# Functions

One of the distinctive things about JavaScript is that functions are first-class objects. This means two important things:

*    functions can be stored in variables and passed around
*    functions can do everything that other objects can do (like having attributes assigned to them).

**First-class citizen**
In programming language design, a first-class citizen (also type, object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a variable.
