## Big O notation
### written as O(), describes how the number of steps in an algorithm scales relative to it's input.

### When we evaluate an algorithm using Big O notation, there are three main things to remember:
- Arbitrarily Large Input
- Drop the Non-Dominant Terms
- Drop Constants

### Examples
-  Constant O(1)          - accessing a variable, calculating something which does not depend on the imput size
-  Linear O(n)            - When the number of operations an algorithm has to perform grows linearly relative to its input, then that algorithm runs in linear time.
-  Quadratic O(n^2)       - nested for loop
-  Logarithmic O(log n)   - binary search
